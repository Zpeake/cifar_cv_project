# cifar_cv_project
CNN build as part of Udacity project. CIFAR10 dataset

In the Intro to Machine Learning with Pytorch course on Udacity, the second section (Deep Learning) contains a project
building an image classifier using the CIFAR10 dataset. Contained in this repository is my Python Notebook. The CIFAR10 dataset is publicly available for download, so it is not included here. I built my own CNN using PyTorch, as opposed to using a prebuilt model like RESNET, so I could learn
how to build a CNN from scratch on my own.
