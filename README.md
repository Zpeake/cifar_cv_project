CNN build as part of Udacity project. CIFAR10 dataset

In the Intro to Machine Learning with Pytorch course on Udacity, the second section (Deep Learning) contains a project
building an image classifier using the CIFAR10 dataset. Contained in this repository are my Python Notebook and all required
data/files to run it. I built my own CNN using PyTorch, as opposed to using a prebuilt model like RESNET, so I could learn
how to build a CNN from scratch on my own.
